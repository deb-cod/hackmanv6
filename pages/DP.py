             However, with busy schedules and limited access to gyms, it can be challenging to maintain a consistent workout routine.
               To overcome this challenge, the concept of virtual gym trainers has gained immense popularity. 
               In this context, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in fitness training has emerged as a game-changer. 
               The AI gym trainer utilizes advanced technologies such as Mediapipe, Python, Numpy, and face position tracking to provide personalized workout plans and guidance to individuals.
                 In this article, we will explore how these technologies work together to create an efficient and effective AI gym trainer."""

Bicep curls: Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing forward. Slowly curl the weights up towards your shoulders, keeping your elbows close to your sides. Pause at the top of the movement before slowly lowering the weights back down.
When performing these exercises, it is important to maintain proper form and control throughout the entire range of motion. To maximize bicep activation, focus on keeping your elbows close to your sides and avoid swinging or using momentum to lift the weights.
Varying the angle of your arms during these exercises can also help target different areas of the biceps. For example, performing curls with your arms slightly angled outwards can place more emphasis on the outer portion of the biceps, while keeping your arms closer to your body can target the inner portion of the muscle.""")

        st.write("""The choice of reps provided for an exercise depends on various factors such as the fitness level of the individual, the specific exercise being performed, the goals of the workout, and the overall training program.\n
For beginners, it is generally recommended to start with lower reps, around 5, to ensure proper form and technique before increasing the weight or reps. As the individual progresses and becomes more comfortable with the exercise, they can gradually increase the reps and weight to challenge their muscles.\n
For moderate level individuals, a range of 15 reps is generally recommended to build endurance and muscular strength. This can help improve overall fitness and prepare the individual for more advanced exercises or training programs.\n
For individuals who are more advanced and looking to increase muscle size and strength, higher reps such as 30 may be more appropriate. This can help create more muscle tension and fatigue, leading to greater muscle growth and strength gains.\n
However, it is important to note that these rep ranges are not set in stone and can be adjusted based on the individual's goals, preferences, and limitations. Some individuals may find that they respond better to higher or lower reps, and it's important to listen to your body and adjust accordingly.\n
Ultimately, the choice of reps should be based on the individual's fitness level, goals, and overall training program. It's important to work with a qualified fitness professional to develop a personalized training program that takes into account these factors and helps you achieve your fitness goals safely and effectively.""")
